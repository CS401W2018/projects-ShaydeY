            <p class="thick oblique align"> Waikiki is on the south shore of the island of Oahu. It is debatebly the most famous and well known beaches on Oahu. The sheer number of people here are intense. Previously a natural featurehttp://127.0.0.1:3000/projects/PageLayout/waikiki.jpeg, through over development it has become almost completely man made. Most of the surrounding city is dedicated to toursim and tourists. </p>

            <p class="oblique">It is here where famous surfer Duke Kahanamoku gained fame and recognition. Due to Dukes influence and rise to fame through the Olympics, many people wanted to learn how to surf. This as a result made Waikiki the surfing central it is now. Currently Waikiki Beach and beaches along this southern shore are all having problems with erosion. This is partly due to the development of Honolulu very close to the shore.</p>
