    <h1>Japan Tokyo North Mission</h1>

    <p>The Japan Tokyo North Mission, or JTMN, was technically the staring place of all church outreach in Japan. It opened in 1901, only to be closed and reopened again multiple times. The latest was in 2019 when it was reformed.</p>

    <p>The Tokyo North Mission, at the time of refomration, covered a significant large portion of Japan. From Nothern Tokyo to Yamagata &amp; Miyagi Prefectures. For referance, that is a 6 hour bullet train rain from top to bottom. As a result of the reopening of Sendai Misision in the summer of 2024, the JTMN now covers most of the greater Tokyo area, just up to Niigata. </p>
