        <h2>What are Indie Games?</h2>
        <p>An <span class="quotecolor">"indie game"</span> literally is the shortened name version of <span class="quotecolor">"independent game."</span> In other words an indie game is an independent game. This means the game was produced by a small/smaller team or sometimes even individuals. This is in comparison to what is considered <span class="quotecolor">"Triple A"</span> games, which are produced by large companies and publishers with huge budgets and hype. Typically indie games have much smaller budgets and are the result of incredibly unique and distinctive ideas. Indie games are well known for its art style, creativity, personal touch, niche genres, and new/wild gameplay mechanics.</p>
        <p>Development in the indie game field started in the early 2000s when gaming was, <em>debatebly</em>, at it's peak! It had little sucess then as it was hard to come into the scene while it is dominated by companies like Nintendo, Ubisoft, and others like them. What really catapulted indie games into mainstream view was the creation of Steam. Steam is a gaming platform that allows people access, and gives ability to purchase, a massive library of a variety of games.</p>

        <h2>About Links</h2>
        <p>A relative link is a link to something else in <em>your</em> domain. Relative links would be used to make it easier to navigate within your own domain. Instead of needing the whole link every time, just the file name &lpar;sometimes the folders as well&rpar; to direct to is needed. Here is an example of a  <a href="../JTMN.html">Relative Link to Previous Project</a> that I did. An absolute link is a complete and total link to any site; within and outisde your domain. All that is needed is the whole URL of a site. For example, this is a absolute link, linking you to one of my favorite indie games. <a href="https://www.slimerancher.com/">Example of an Indie Game</a></p>
