        <h2>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h2>
        <p style="color:lightcoral";><strong><em>Inline CSS</em></strong> - uses the style <strong>attribute</strong> within a line of code. Don't use; 2nd priority <br> 
        <strong><em>Embedded CSS</em></strong> - uses the style <strong>tag</strong> as its own set of code in the header. Uses a CSS Selector to declare what to affect. Don't use <br>
        <strong><em>External CSS</em></strong> - putting all CSS in another file. Needs to be named in a file with ".css". Use this one.</p>
        <h2>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h2>
        <p>Seperation of concerns. Helps browsers display things correctly, as well as see/understand intended things. Keeping html code for the info and css code for design seperate. Also for good scalability and cohesiveness. More sites all only need 1 css file. </p>
        <h2>What is a selector used for?</h2>
        <p>A selector is used to declare what part of your code &lpar;tag&rpar; is affected by your CSS code.</p>
