            <p>Welcome to the world of Explosions!!! Think of this as a mini blog and informational about explosives. These pages and sites cover a varitey of topics all revolving around explosives, a topic I thoroughly enjoy. Since I am a nerd about chemisty and explosive reactions, these sites cover what I find to be interesting, intruiging, and fun! Whether youre interested in the chemical side of things, the history, the future, or just want to see something blow up, this is the place for you! I hope you learn something and enjoy! </p>

                <p>One of my favorite YouTube channels that got me through COVID was called Explosions and Fire, which one of his videos is to the right. Highly reccomend if youre interested in explosives or lighting things on fire &lpar;you arsonist&rpar;. He does a lot of fun chemistry &lpar;a lot of which is way more complicated than your home chemsitry set but still fun to watch the results&rpar;, and gives really detailed explinations about what hes doing. From which I've learned an assorment of Fun Facts about blowing things up such as: White Phosphorus &lpar;a well known dangerous chemical banned in war use due to it being insanely innhumane&rpar; is sticky. Meaning when it explodes, and continues to explode, it sticks to whatever it lands on. But I digress, heres some chemical sneak peaks!</p>
