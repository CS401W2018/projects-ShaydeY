            <p>Chemistry, the first class I ever actually enjoyed in highschool. This page is all about the straight chemistry behind all these explosives and explosions. I have decided to showcase a few cool ones on this page and one of my favorites in the embedded YouTube video. I will have the site / PDF linked for full details as always. If you're a science nerd like me, this is the page for you.</p>

            <p>This video showcases something called Nitrogen Triiodide, otherwise known as Touch Powder. One of the coolest &lpar;and relatively safe&rpar; explosives out there. Why? well watch the video, then the name and reason will make sense. Nitrogen Triiodide, which I'll just refer to as Touch Powder, is well known in the explosives world becuase of how unstable it is. As seen from the video it is an extremely sensitive contact explosive. Although it is an explosive its synthesis is actually quite simple in a classroom setting, or for anyone with the right equipment. <a href="https://edu.rsc.org/exhibition-chemistry/nitrogen-triiodide-a-sensitive-contact-explosive/2020065.article">This</a> is a link to one such procedure walking you through it. I will second it's warning though, "Quantities must be kept small so that the demonstration is safe. Do not be tempted to deviate from the method."</p>
