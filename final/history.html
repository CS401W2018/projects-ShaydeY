            <h3>It Starts with Black Powder...</h3>
            <p>Black powder is a mix of saltpetre, sulfur, and charcoal. No one knows who actually invented black powder, but most people think it started in China around the 10th century. Back then, it was mainly used for fireworks and signals. Eventualy, the Chinese might've used it in bombs, and by the mid-1200s, they were using it in bamboo tubes to shoot stones. Kind of like early cannons, which is awesome. Some evidence suggests the Arabs might have invented black powder instead. By around 1300, they had definitely created the first real gunâ€”a bamboo tube strengthened with iron that used black powder to shoot an arrow.</p>
